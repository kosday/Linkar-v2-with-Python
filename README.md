# Linkar with Python

Here you can find two different types of python demos.

In folder "with_Linkar_Clients" is the demo that uses the old C client library with the help of the wrapper "LinkarClientPy.py".

And in folder "with_Linkar_Framework" is the demo that uses the new Linkar Framework Python libraries, that are written integrally in Python.
The base library Linkar Python requires the Linkar Framework Private C Library (included in the download of the Linkar Framework Python Library)
