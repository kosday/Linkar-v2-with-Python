#Linkar with Python

Here you can find two different types of python demos.

In folder "with Linkar Clients" is the demo that uses the old C client library with the help of the wrapper "LinkarClientPy.py".

And in folder "with Linkar Framework" is the demo that uses the new Linkar Framework Python libraries, that are written integrally in Python.
The base library Linkar Python requires the Linkar Framework Private C Library (included in the download of the Linkar Framework Python Library)
