# Linkar with Python

Here are two "demos" of Python:
- Demo.py
- LkDataDemo.py

These demos use the Linkar Framework Python Library.
The Linkar Framework Library must be downloaded in order to use these demos.
This library depends of Linkar Framework Private C Library.
This private library is also include in the download of the Linkar Framework Python Library.
This demo was tested in Windows Python v.3.9.5


## Demo.py
This demo uses functions of the persistent type and with MV input and output data. The results are always structured strings.
Using functions from the Linkar.Strings.StringFunctions module, you can extract and modify information from these strings.


## LkDataDemo.py
This demo uses the same types of functions. But add the LkData classes and their derivates and helpers (LkItem and LkItems).
With these classes it is possible to manage the results and data to be sent in a much more friendly way.
Instead of structured strings, objects and methods are used.
